# Student-Management-system
This Bash script is a terminal-based  (SMS). It uses text files to store login and student data. Teachers log in with default ID and pass. They can add, view, search, edit, or delete records. The system shows passed/failed students by CGPA and can sort data by name, roll, or CGPA. Grades and CGPA are auto-calculated from marks.
